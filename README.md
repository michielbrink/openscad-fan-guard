# openscad fan guard
You can use this script to generate a fan guard so you can lasercut awesome holes for Fans.

To use your fan in you project, export your fan guard to DXF in openscad.

If you want to use the circle option (like circles.bmp) you have to delete the outermost line in the DXF because otherwise your are cutter the whole object out of your project.
